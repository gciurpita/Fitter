# Fitter
Java model railroad layout planning tool

greg ciurpita
i am an embedded firmware developer with experience in communication products at Bell Labs and Qualcomm.
Fitter is 3rd my Java application that attempts to graphically show and edit model railroad trackwork.
It got started with an idea for using three points to determine a curve and curve fitting thru points.

Fitter has substantial ability to edit (add, change, delete) points to modify trackwork
but does not have all features to create a trackplan from scratch.
I would also like to see it include electrical information (e.g. blocks or power districts, turnout labels).
